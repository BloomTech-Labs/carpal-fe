## Carpal

Carpals is a app that safely connects communities and commuters going in the same direction living in the same area to save money, reduce environmental & infrastructural impact by CarPalling.

## Persona(s)

Karen has a 40-mile commute in Los Angeles, which equates to a 90-minute drive each way. Karen is burning through her money and beating up her car. She'd really love to carpool with someone who lives near her, but she doesn't know how or where or how to meet them.

Someone who cares about traffic

## 2️⃣ Payment API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  NODE_ENV - this is the environment in which the application is running.

# 5️⃣ Content Licenses

🚫For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table

| Image Filename  | Source / Creator | License                          |

# 4️⃣ Testing

For Front-end testing we're using React Testing Library(RTL) to perform testing of our components. RTL comes packed with a suite of tests.

We're also using code-climate (run as part of our CI/CD process) to determine test coverage and code maintainability.

Yup fhas been setup or form validation

# 4️⃣ Installation Instructions

🚫explain how to install the required dependencies to get this project up and running with yarn and NPM

Use 'npm install' to install all necessary dependencies

## Other Scripts

🚫replace these examples with your own

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created; if used locally, creates a local instance of a server at localhost:3000
    * eject - used to modify CRA dependencies
    *coverage - runs a test coverage report that is displayed t the top of this readme
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them

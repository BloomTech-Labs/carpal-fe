## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/61U4A461/labspt8-carpal)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/69bb693ef3c64001819f1f5e883c6e04?v=28f3724c63774c2691731ba2648a36c6)

## Carpal

Carpals is a app that safely connects communities and commuters going in the same direction living in the same area to save money, reduce environmental & infrastructural impact by CarPalling.

## Persona(s)

Karen has a 40-mile commute in Los Angeles, which equates to a 90-minute drive each way. Karen is burning through her money and beating up her car. She'd really love to carpool with someone who lives near her, but she doesn't know how or where or how to meet them.

Someone who cares about traffic

Someone who does not have reliable transport and need to carpool.

Someone who cares about the environment.

## Problem

Karen is not making enough to finance her commute. The wear and tear on her car and the rising cost of gas is bankrupting her.

-   Problem 1 - People spend money on their cars and gas in long and rough stop and go commutes. All the while wear and tear adds up on their cars.
-   Problem 2 - Environmental impact of cars on the road
-   Problem 3 - Lack of current transportation/car
-   Problem 4 - Person concerned with impact on aging US infrastructure
-   Problem 5 - Stressed out by commute
-   Problem 6 - Wants to Meet People
-   Problem 7 - Karen scored a DUI and still needs to get to work

## Mission

To safely connect communities and commuters going in the same direction living in the same area to save money, reduce environmental & infrastructural impact by CarPalling.

# APIs

## See API Details in the Backend Documentation

[Backend Documentation](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/carpal-be/blob/master/README.md)

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN - API Token to Utilize Mapbox
    *  REACT_APP_IS_STAGING - Set equal to 1 in order for axios to properly interface with the appropriate backend environment

# Testing

For Front-end testing we're using React Testing Library(RTL) & Jest to perform testing of our components. RTL comes packed with a suite of tests.

We're also using code-climate (run as part of our CI/CD process) to determine test coverage and code maintainability.

Yup has been setup for form validation

# Installation Instructions

Use 'npm install' to install all necessary dependencies

## Other Scripts

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created; if used locally, creates a local instance of a server at localhost:3000
    * eject - used to modify CRA dependencies
    * coverage - runs a test coverage report that is displayed at the top of this readme
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory
